# xdc-lang
A language that is so terrible it makes you laugh.

## Disclaimer
Don't die of laughter when the compiler fails.

This language was just to test functions.

If this grows into a major project, don't expect any sequels.

## A little extra
This language was originally gonna be called CBSLang. Then XDLang. But I wanted to include C because I like C.
